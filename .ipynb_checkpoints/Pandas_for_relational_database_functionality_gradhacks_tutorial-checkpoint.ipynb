Such a document was usually prepared in the context of a legal dispute, sometimes to replace missing or damaged legal deeds. It was nearly always sealed and verified by an Islamic judge, a qazi. Mughal Mahzar Namas often began with a quote from the Quran exhorting witnesses not to conceal testimony. They were different from mahzars in the Marathi-writing parts of the country, which were records of decisions made by judicial assemblies. In Sunni Hanafi legal texts such as the imperially sponsored Fatawa-yi Alamgiri, mahzars are similarly described as documents that recorded the proceedings of a legal dispute.\"</td>\n",

It consists of a statement of facts regarding a property, a person or certain events, solicited by specific persons, and attested to by their professional and social associates. Such a document was usually prepared in the context of a legal dispute, sometimes to replace missing or damaged legal deeds. It was nearly always sealed and verified by an Islamic judge, a qazi. Mughal Mahzar Namas often began with a quote from the Quran exhorting witnesses not to conceal testimony. They were different from mahzars in the Marathi-writing parts of the country, which were records of decisions made by judicial assemblies. In Sunni Hanafi legal texts such as the imperially sponsored Fatawa-yi Alamgiri, mahzars are similarly described as documents that recorded the proceedings of a legal dispute.\"   \n",

    "One of the wonderful things about opensource data formats is that you are not limited to any one single application. A minimalist use case of Pandas would be to use its joining functionality to produce various permutations of different merges as your needs dictate and then export those merged tables back to CSV to use in other programs (e.g., Excel). Or you can run your searches within the Jupyter notebook, as we did above. Or you could write functions to create interactive searches on your command line - which is easier than it sounds.\n",

For instance, if you were tracking social network relationships in your database, you could use the above methods to get your data in the right format and subset that you need, and then visualize those relationships graphically right within your Jupyter notebook. Ditto for geospatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, for now, let's get this merged table back into a CSV file just so that we know how to do so (it is currently saved in a local dataframe variable within this instance of Jupyter notebook). *Caution*: you would not want to modify data after the export of the merged table; it is only really for reference and viewing. Your 'base' data should be those original CSV files. Remember, you can run this entire routine in an instance since it is code, so there is no real drawback to having separate tables for analysis and data entry.\n",
