    "One of the wonderful things about opensource data formats is that you are not limited to any one single application. A minimalist use case of Pandas would be to use its joining functionality to produce various permutations of different merges as your needs dictate and then export those merged tables back to CSV to use in other programs (e.g., Excel). Or you can run your searches within the Jupyter notebook, as we did above. Or you could write functions to create interactive searches on your command line - which is easier than it sounds.\n",

Ditto for geospatial analysis.\n",

    "But, for now, let's get this merged table back into a CSV file just so that we know how to do so (it is currently saved in a local dataframe variable within this instance of Jupyter notebook). *Caution*: you would not want to modify data after the export of the merged table; it is only really for reference and viewing. Your 'base' data should be those original CSV files. Remember, you can run this entire routine in an instance since it is code, so there is no real drawback to having separate tables for analysis and data entry.\n",
